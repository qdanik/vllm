"""PoC Engine Patch for vLLM 0.15.1 V1 Engine.

This module patches the V1 AsyncLLM class to add poc_request support,
enabling PoC (Proof of Compute) artifact generation.

PoC Priority:
    PoC has priority over inference. When PoC generation is active, the
    chat and completion API endpoints reject new requests with 503.

    IMPORTANT: PoC's execute_poc_forward reuses KV cache blocks starting
    from block 0 (both as scratch for inputs_embeds and as the attention
    slot mapping).  If any inference request still has KV blocks allocated,
    PoC will overwrite them and permanently corrupt the model output.

    Therefore poc_request aborts all in-flight inference requests before
    issuing collective_rpc.  The API-level 503 gating prevents new
    requests from arriving while PoC is active.

Usage:
    Import this module early in the application startup to apply the patch.

    Only supports 'generate_artifacts' action. All PoC state (generation
    loop, nonce counter, stats) is managed in the API layer.
    
    Before issuing the GPU work this method aborts all in-flight inference
    requests.  This is required because execute_poc_forward writes into
    KV-cache blocks starting from block 0; if any request still holds
    those blocks the KV data is corrupted and the model produces garbage
    for the rest of its lifetime.
